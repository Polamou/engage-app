     The citizen engagement application

  <h6>How does work Engage ?</h6>
    <p>
    The application has two sections. The first one is the issues and te second is the user profil.
    On the issues, we can see all the irregularities they are on the street that people have posted.
    If you click on one issue, you can have the details of this one like pictures, the adresse of it, its state
    or even some comment about it.
    The second section is your profil. You can edit it at any time.
   </p>

   <h6>How to declare an issue ?</h6>
     <p>
       If you see an issue on the road, you can at any time take a picture of it and post it on the application.
       You have to go on "issues" and "add issue" to be allow to add one. Pictures are not required but it always
       better to see at what the issue look like.
