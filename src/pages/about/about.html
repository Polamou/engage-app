     <h3>Engage</h3>
        <p>
   A citizen engagement application
  </p>


      <h6>What is Engage ?</h6>
      <p>
      Engage is used to inform the administration of the city about something broken somewhere in the town.
      The problem can be a grafiti against a wall, a broken street lamp, a gap in a road, and so on...
      The idea is when someone sees an irregularity on the street, they inform the person concerned by
      sending an issue on the application.
